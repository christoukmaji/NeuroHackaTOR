## Description
```
Our project aims to help students adjust to a new medium of learning with the necessary tools. 
By looking at brain waves associated with focus levels, we can improve concentration which in 
turn enhances the online learning experience.
```
## The Struggles of E-Learning
```
Since the beginning of the pandemic, millions of students have moved to online learning.
This sudden shift has led students to have to face new challenges, such as:
- The loss of concentration during class
    - Missing important information and due dates
- Incomplete school work due to internal and external distractions
    - Internal: anxiety and emotional distress, peer pressure
    - External: family time, the aroma of food
- Mental fatigue
    - Lack of motivation to study and keep up with classes
    - Brain fog 
```
## The Solution

## How It Works

## Results

## Project Architecture

## Technology Used 
```
Web Application: React
Data Cleaning and Analysis: Python
Hardware: 8-channel OpenBCI Cyton Board
```
## Public EEG Datasets
```
We wanted to test our implementation with professionally-taken data(i.e. multiple participants,
multiple trials, 64-channel EEG) to see if our results improved, diminished, or remained consistent.
```
## Problems and Future Improvements
```
- Noisy user data 
  - Most likely because we used tape instead of electrode glue
- Algorithmic Improvements
  -An fine-tuned algorithm that clearly defines the difference between the state of
   “focus” and the state of “distraction”
